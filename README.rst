Repository for LaTeX_ packages related to the `United States Air Force
Academy`_. Most packages relate to teaching, such as Beamer themes for
presentations.

In many cases, these packages mirror "official" templates provided by the
Academy (typically for Microsoft Office), but some are derived from other LaTeX
packages for consistency of presentation.

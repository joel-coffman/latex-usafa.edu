This repository comprises LaTeX_ packages related to the `United States Air
Force Academy`_ (USAFA), including the following:

Beamer themes
  Beamer_ is a LaTeX class for presentations and supports *themes* to change
  the appearance of a presentation. The following themes are implemented in
  this repository:

  `falcon (color theme)`_
    A color theme derived from USAFA's official color palette

  `usafa.edu (presentation theme)`_
    A presentation theme that incorporates USAFA's color palette, logo, motto,
    etc.

`graded-review`_
  A package to format graded reviews (GRs)

`promotion`_
  A package for applications for academic promotion

In many cases, these packages mirror official Microsoft Office templates used
by the Academy, but some liberties are taken, particularly to provide
consistency with other LaTeX packages.

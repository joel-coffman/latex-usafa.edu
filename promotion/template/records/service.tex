    I regularly receive an invitation to review manuscripts in my areas of expertise for one of the premier teaching journals.
    My reviews require me to read, evaluate, and write a response to accept or reject the manuscript.
  }{
    I serve as an important gatekeeper for publications.
    I have rejected 95\% of the manuscripts I have received.
    This required me to write an extensive response to justify my rejection, as well as provide feedback and constructive criticism to the authorsl
    My recommendations have been overridden by the Editor-in-Chief only one time.

    I serve as a teaching mentor for new and returning faculty members during faculty orientation.

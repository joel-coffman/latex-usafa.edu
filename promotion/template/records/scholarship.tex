      This work is an outgrowth of the Course Design Retreats that I co-created and co-led during the sumemrs of 2008--2014.

      \item
      I wrote 3 of the 10 chapters and worked closely with my co-authors on the entire publication.
      This involved editing, revising, referencing, and illustrating the book.
      The author team spent three years working closely together to bring this book from conception to bound book.

      \item
      Our innovative book breaks new ground in the area of design college courses.
      Its novel workbox approach is used in faculty development workshops throughout the country.

      Stylus Publishing is one of the top two educational publisters in the US and the UK (see URL or attached supplemental material for their extensive catalog).

      \item A day-long workshop (0800--1630)
      \item We presented this workshop to 25 instructors in the Advanced Space Operations School.
      \item We supported the education and training mission of this AF schoolhouse. Our strategy tapped into their experiences with learning failures in their courses and then connected them to the six elements of our course design model. The afternoon was spent looking for solutions to these learning breakdowns and failures.
      \item I co-created and co-presented this workshop with Dr.~Steve Jones.

    \begin{itemize}
      \item Steve and I were invited to provide expert support to the education and training mission of AFASOS.
      \item While AFASOS has a robust instructor training component, like most college instructors, they receive little training on how to design effective courses.
      \item In this way we helped fill a gap in their training and education. Helping instructors solve their teaching challenges is always rewarding and improves the training of airmen entering their programs.
